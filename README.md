# SpellingErrorGenerator
Simple spelling error generator that takes a line of text and adds a specified number of spelling errors. The code prioritizes using a text reference of common english word misspellings pulled from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lists_of_common_misspellings. 

This list could be updated to manually add misspellings that should be recognized. After this list has been searched, the program will randomly replace and duplicate letters until the designated number of errors is reached.
